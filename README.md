Creative Coding Project 4

This is a game similar to the style of flappy bird, but with a halloween style to it.
There is a ghost that moves up and down. the objective is to get the ghost through the gap in the pipes.
It is played by pressing the 'a' key to push the ghost upward. Once you press the 'a' key the sounds will also begin to play.
There are two sounds. one is a thud that is made everytime the play presses the 'a' key. the other is background sound. 
The pipes are set in an array so that they can be continuously generated onto and off of the screen. 
When the ghost hits a pipe the pipe turns black to show that occurance of this collision. 
I used my perlin noise clouds from project 3 as the background in this one also because since the pipes are moving I wanted the background to be moving as well.
